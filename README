Math Expression to LaTeX Converter
This application transcribes spoken math expressions and converts them to LaTeX format. It uses Whisper for speech-to-text and offers two parsing options:

A custom rule-based parser
OpenAI's GPT-4 for more complex expressions

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
pip (Python package manager)
Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

Installation Steps

Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/y0useff/HawkMath
cd HawkMath

Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate



Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the Whisper model
Option 1: Let the application download the model automatically on first run
Option 2: Download the model manually from:

GitHub: https://github.com/openai/whisper
Direct link for base English model: base.en.pt

When downloading manually, place the model file in a directory of your choice (you'll reference this location in your .env file).
Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following content:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
FILE_PATH=/path/to/your/whisper/model/base.en.pt
Replace:

your_openai_api_key_here with your OpenAI API key (get one from OpenAI's platform)
/path/to/your/whisper/model/base.en.pt with the path to your downloaded Whisper model file


Create uploads directory
mkdir uploads


Running the Application

Start the Flask server
bashpython app.py

Access the application
Open your web browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000

Using the Application

Click the microphone button and speak a math expression
Choose your preferred parsing method:
Custom rule-based parser (better for simpler expressions)
"GPT" for the GPT-4 powered parser (better for complex expressions)
